\description{
A vector with the hex values for NVI's profile colours.
}
\details{
The colour codes are based on the hex values except for the body text
where the cmyk value is used. There is not agreement between the hex and
cmyk values, but hex seem to give the most correct colour.

The script for preparing the palette is given in "./data-raw/generate_NVI_palettes_2020.R".
